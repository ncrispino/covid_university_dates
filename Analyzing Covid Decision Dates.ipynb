    "## Goal\n",
    "In this notebook, I will clean and preprocess the data, then feed it to some basic machine learning models, with a goal of predicting the number of days until a given university acts (relative to the first university's action in that category). So, if I put the features corresponding to WashU in my model, I may get 3 as an output, which would mean WashU is predicted to impose covid restrictions 3 days after the first mover.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note (important):** There are many problems in my input data. First, there's not enough of it (only 51 samples) due to the difficulty of collecting the data. Also, there's likely not enough features--a large one I'm missing is the incidence rate of COVID in each zip code during the period where decisions were made. This may make the model more accurate. Second, there are a lot of interconnectivities between the data, meaning the iid assumption is violated. It's almost always realistic for this assumption to be violated, but in this model it is especially problematic, as universities likely base their decisions on the status of other, similar universities. So, this model is flawed. However, it is based on a novel problem I thought about and could possibly possess some small degree of predictive power. Whatever the outcome, it will have been good practice, especially with getting the data into a workable form.\n",

    "### Extracting Data from Zip Codes Using the Census Bureau Data API\n",
    "As inspired by [this article on leveraging value from postal codes](https://towardsdatascience.com/leveraging-value-from-postal-codes-naics-codes-area-codes-and-other-funky-arse-categorical-be9ce75b6d5a), I'll extract mean information for each zip code and use as features, not the zip code itself. I'm following [these reddit comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/i2g55u/demographic_data_sets_by_zip_code_free/) as a guide. I will be using the [census package](https://pypi.org/project/census/) for Python and the census api. Also, I'm storing my api key as an env variable so I don't accidentally push it to Github. See [here](https://able.bio/rhett/how-to-set-and-get-environment-variables-in-python--274rgt5) for more.\n",

I would prefer to use data from 2020-2022, which is when colleges made these decisions, but unfortunately that's not available.

    "Now, get all COVID data before the first vaccine mandate in my data (4/2/2021) and aggregate. This will give a general idea on the different caseloads in each county. However, it will not be entirely useful, as cases can fluctuate in a fairly short period of time. What I want to know is if a lack of COVID cases or a large amount of COVID cases can cause a different action regarding vaccination mandates. To get this effect, I will average all the COVID community levels over the time period, which measure [\"the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days\"](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html). A 0 corresponds to \"low\", a 1 to \"medium\", and a 2 to \"high\". I will use \"canCommunityLevel\" (which is the CDC community level based on CovidActNow data) as it has less 'None' values."
