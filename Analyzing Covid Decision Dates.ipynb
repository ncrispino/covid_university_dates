    "## Goal\n",
    "In this notebook, I will clean and preprocess the data, then feed it to some basic machine learning models, with a goal of predicting the number of days until a given university acts (relative to the first university's action in that category). So, if I put the features corresponding to WashU in my model, I may get 3 as an output, which would mean WashU is predicted to impose covid restrictions 3 days after the first mover.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note (important):** There are many problems in my input data. First, there's not enough of it (only 51 samples) due to the difficulty of collecting the data. Also, there's likely not enough features--a large one I'm missing is the incidence rate of COVID in each zip code during the period where decisions were made. This may make the model more accurate. Second, there are a lot of interconnectivities between the data, meaning the iid assumption is violated. It's almost always realistic for this assumption to be violated, but in this model it is especially problematic, as universities likely base their decisions on the status of other, similar universities. So, this model is flawed. However, it is based on a novel problem I thought about and could possibly possess some small degree of predictive power. Whatever the outcome, it will have been good practice, especially with getting the data into a workable form."

A college town may often lean left, but the state legislature represents overall political sentiment and has a direct impact on COVID guidelines, so I think it'll be more useful. I will use the data from [the ncsl](https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/Elections/Legis_Control_2020_April%201.pdf) for who controlled the state legislature in 2020, filled in as Rep for Nebraska after a Google and Dem for DC as it votes heavily Democratic. Hardcoded because it's only 50 samples and pretty basic."
