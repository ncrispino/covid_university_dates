    "## Goal\n",
    "In this notebook, I will clean the data; in another notebook, I will finish preprocessing it then feed it to some basic machine learning models, with 1) a goal of predicting the number of days until a given university acts (relative to the first university's action in that category) and 2) predicting vaccine status. So, for the former if I put the features corresponding to WashU in my model, I may get three as an output, which would mean WashU is predicted to impose covid restrictions three days after the first mover. For the latter, the model will decide whether the university has implemented a vaccine mandate given the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note (important for my first modeling problem):** There are many problems in my input data. First, there's not enough of it (only 51 samples) due to the difficulty of collecting the data. Also, there's likely not enough features or they were designed incorrectly--a large part is my Census data and COVID-related data, where my choices were somewhat arbitrary on what to include. Second, there are a lot of interconnectivities between the data, meaning the iid assumption for machine learning is violated. It's almost always realistic for this assumption to be violated, but in this model it is especially problematic, as universities likely base their decisions on the status of other, similar universities. So, this model is flawed. However, it is based on a novel problem I thought about and could possibly possess some small degree of predictive power. Whatever the outcome, it will have been good practice, especially with getting the data into a workable form and learning how to run models.\n",

    "### Extracting Data from Zip Codes Using the Census Bureau Data API\n",
    "As inspired by [this article on leveraging value from postal codes](https://towardsdatascience.com/leveraging-value-from-postal-codes-naics-codes-area-codes-and-other-funky-arse-categorical-be9ce75b6d5a), I'll extract mean information for each zip code and use as features, not the zip code itself. I'm following [these reddit comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/i2g55u/demographic_data_sets_by_zip_code_free/) as a guide. I will be using the [census package](https://pypi.org/project/census/) for Python and the census api. Also, I'm storing my api key as an env variable so I don't accidentally push it to Github. See [here](https://able.bio/rhett/how-to-set-and-get-environment-variables-in-python--274rgt5) for more.\n",

To get this effect, I will average all the COVID community levels over the time period, which measure [\"the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days\"](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html).

A college town may often lean left, but the state legislature represents overall political sentiment and has a direct impact on COVID guidelines, so I think it'll be useful as well and not redundant.\n",

Hardcoded because it's only 50 samples and pretty basic."
