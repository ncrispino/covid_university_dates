# covid_university_dates
Tracking dates of COVID-related decisions made by top universities and analyzing them.

Uses [Uni-rank](https://github.com/nahid18/uni-rank) package to get baseline data; columns with COVID-related decisions were created by me.

Most of the dates should be correct (or at least within a few days of being correct); however, let me know if I've made a mistake, or am missing data you have.

Use "cleaned_university_covid_dates" for any projects.

Main cleaning and analysis done in "Analyzing Covid Decision Dates". Read descriptions there for advice in shaping the code.
