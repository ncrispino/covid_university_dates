# covid_university_dates
Predicting aspects of university COVID guidelines using machine learning.

- Data cleaning is done in 'Analyzing Covid Decision Dates.' A generalized script is in cleaning.py
- Preprocessing and model creation is done in 'Covid Model Creation.'
- Model script is in model.py

<details><summary>I also attempted to track specific actions made by universities in covid_dates_creation</summary><br/>

Uses [Uni-rank](https://github.com/nahid18/uni-rank) package to get baseline data; columns with COVID-related decisions were created by me.

Most of the dates should be correct (or at least within a few days of being correct); however, let me know if I've made a mistake, or am missing data you have.

Use "cleaned_university_covid_dates" for any projects, though you probably want to clean the code more, as done in my machine learning prep files.
