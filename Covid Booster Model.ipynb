    "##  Predicting Booster\n",
    "Create a classification model that tells us whether or not universities mandate a booster *given* they already mandated a vaccine. Uses preprocessing from \"Covid Model Creation\" notebook. Note that this analysis better aligns with the iid assumption needed for machine learning--choosing dates to implement vaccine requirements is very much based on the action of other colleges. However, we can assume that choosing to implement a requirement is not *entirely* based on the actions of other institutions; once vaccination requirements seemed imminent, colleges evaluate their own situations and (likely) chose based on the science and social consequences for their students and surrounding environment, especially for a booster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, I'd like to train a model to classify the universities that required the vaccine and those that didn't. Then, I would want to try a multi-level classification with three options: one for no mandate, one for a regular mandate, and one for a booster mandate. However, the lack of schools in the data without a vaccine mandate makes this analysis more difficult. Since my dataset is small, the model will likely overfit on those small examples and provide bad generalization. Still, I may try this after I finish with my booster analysis."

For example, if we are doing 5-fold CV in the outer loop, we take the data from 4 folds, combine it into one dataset, then split that set into k folds and run CV. This will better account for the variance of the test set--same motivation as regular cross validation accounting for the variance of the validation set. Also note that in the previous example we select 5 best models and see the generalization error on each of them. We can choose one of those models or ensemble those models.

Therefore it would be wrong to choose a model based on the results of the outer loop. Instead, the estimates of the all the errors in outer loop for a specific model are averaged to provide the approximate generalization error for that model fitting method when all the data is used. After nested CV is done, apply your inner CV methods with all the data to select the optimal hyperparameters, using the results from nested CV as estimates for this procedure.\n",

This means that the inner CV process will be repeated on each of the training sets separated by the outer CV process.
